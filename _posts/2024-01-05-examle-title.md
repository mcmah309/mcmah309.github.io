# Welcome to My First Post!

This is an example of how to create a Jekyll post with proper tags and categories.

## What are Categories?

Categories are broad topics that group your posts. Think of them as the main sections of your blog:
- Tutorial
- Personal
- Technology
- Travel

## What are Tags?

Tags are more specific keywords that describe the content of your post:
- beginner
- advanced
- web-development
- javascript
- css

## Content Example

Here's some sample content to show how the post looks:

### Code Example

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, Jekyll!"
end
```

### Lists Work Too

- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

That's it! This post will now appear on your site with the specified categories and tags.
