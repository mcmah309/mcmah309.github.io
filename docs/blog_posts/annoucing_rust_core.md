# Announcing Rust Core in Dart: Program in Dart Like You Would in Rust

For Rust developers involved in programming with Dart, or Dart developers interested in idiomatic and safe programming, we have developed "rust_core," a package designed to implement Rust's core library in Dart. `Result`, `Option`, `Cell`, `OnceCell`, `LazyCell`, etc. Are all done, along with nearly 200 extension methods for different scenarios, such as `Future<Result<S,F>>`, `Result<Option<S>,F>`, `Result<S?,F>`, etc. just to name a few.
